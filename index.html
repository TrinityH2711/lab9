	<p>According to google the definition of fashion is “a popular trend, especially in styles of dress and ornament or manners of behaviour.” You can imagine how much fashion has evolved due to how much people and society have changed over the years. I believe that the introduction to new materials is a big part of why fashion has changed so much. For example, in the earliest ages of clothing it was made from natural elements such as plants and animal skin/fur etc. Over the years new materials were introduced and created to make clothing some of these materials include cotton, polyester, silk, wool, and leather, the list goes on and on. Fashion used to be more cultural but is now used to express personal style. You can clearly see the change of fashion trends through out the years in the photo above…
